# MapQuest-API

This is a simple GPS TUI that uses the MapQuest API. 
The user inputs two or three locations they wish to travel, and enters 
their full addresses. Afterward, the user is given the option to 
include directions, latitude and longitude of all locations, time 
it takes to travel in minutes, and total distance in miles.

## Run the program

```
python mapquestrun.py
